"Your controller is fairly unoriginal but I think with good haptic feed it would improve on previous designs.
The game, however, is intriguing and I like the concept."

"I like the face that you are creating an old skl arcade game like time crisis, i miss there games in my life.
the contoler itself is just a gun and tbf that not all the unique."

"Very innovative idea Konrad.
The controller seems pretty versatile and looks like it might function quite well.
The game design idea does appear to be quite a fun sounding idea.
The game does seem very similar to other games that have already been done so maybe you could some sort of unique selling point perhaps?"

Respond:

Despite the mixed feedback I wont be changing the design of my controller. Most feedbacks focus upon similarity to old arcade mashines BUT as said in the research, they are not compatible anymore with current technologies so they shouldn't be considered as valid controllers. Also, it has things that previous controllers never had like reloading system where you have to manually remove a magazine to reload or some controllers never had vibrations in them.

In terms of the game, I want to focus upon something simplistic not overcomplicated and fun with potential of being played by two players to compete with each other or to cooperate with implementation of it if the time allows me to do so. Game proposal was showing just basic outline of the game that I will be making.
